arm-devel-infrastructure
------------------------

Provide generic [Debian Linux](https://www.debian.org/) disk images for
PCs(amd64) and ARM devices. These can be used in development environments
or server installs and are based on [vmdb2](https://vmdb2.liw.fi/) plus
automatic scripts for configuration.
Also include useful links to some key Linux development projects (for arm).

Arm disk images are prepared for generic arm64 or armhf devices,
there are extra images for [Raspberry-Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/).

Disk images can be downloaded from [https://github.com/laroche/arm-devel-infrastructure/releases](https://github.com/laroche/arm-devel-infrastructure/releases)

A fairly generic desktop image is also available from
[here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1DyV9IfeaVoIdlGsouYNVLAzxjr3jtuE_/view?usp=sharing).
Please test this out on as much as possible hardware and provide feedback to Debian on hardware enablement/support.
