------------------------

Provide generic [Debian Linux](https://www.debian.org/) disk images for
PCs(amd64) and ARM devices. These can be used in development environments
or server installs and are based on [vmdb2](https://vmdb2.liw.fi/) plus
automatic scripts for configuration.
Also include useful links to some key Linux development projects (for arm).

Arm disk images are prepared for generic arm64 or armhf devices,
there are extra images for [Raspberry-Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/).

Disk images can be downloaded from [https://github.com/laroche/arm-devel-infrastructure/releases](https://github.com/laroche/arm-devel-infrastructure/releases)

A fairly generic x86_64/amd64 desktop image is available from
[Debian-12-Desktop-LegacyBoot](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1JfyKxd_X1RSg0jI7p6XFXRO1-dIXwrZX/view?usp=drive_link) and
[Debian-13-Desktop-LegacyBoot](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bhthP4ve-SjHAfn6qRokjXoxYQkt8knk/view?usp=drive_link)
(older hardware with BIOS legacy boot and MSDOS partitioning).
For newer hardare an UEFI-image is available at
[Debian-12-Desktop-SecureBoot](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1F3UicklztS9bVhxdNvqjM_IYyYyVkDQP/view?usp=drive_link) and
[Debian-13-Desktop-SecureBoot](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KbSRYj4FQVvO7sgA8ZlfPmTASgVDC0ZU/view?usp=drive_link)
(newer hardware with UEFI secure boot and GPT partitioning).
Please test this out on as much as possible hardware and provide feedback to Debian on hardware enablement/support.
I am also glad to enhance this as a generic usage Linux image.
